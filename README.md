# What is PostgreSQL?
Cosmos DB is a massively scalable NoSQL database that's available to your application as a fully managed Platform as a Service that runs on Azure. There are comprehensive service level agreements on throughput, latency, consistency, and availability. Cosmos DB also delivers blazing fast reads and writes, typically within 10 ms or less, whether you've got gigabytes, terabytes or petabytes of data. Cosmos DB automatically manages the growth of your data by horizontally partitioning the workload behind the scenes. The process is completely transparent and provides the elastic scale for virtually unlimited storage to handle volume, as well as throughput for velocity. Like all Azure services, Cosmos DB runs in many Microsoft data centers throughout the world.
