## Clean up resources

You can clean up the resources that you created in the Quickstart in one of two ways. You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group. If you want to keep the other resources intact, delete only the server resource.


To delete the entire resource group, including the newly created server:

1. Locate your resource group in the portal. On the menu on the left, select **Resource groups**. Then select the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**.

2. On your resource group page, select **Delete**. Enter the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**, in the text box to confirm deletion. Select **Delete**.

To delete only the newly created server:

1. Locate your server in the portal, if you don't have it open. On the menu on the left, select **All resources**. Then search for the server you created.

2. On the **Overview** page, select **Delete**.

3. Confirm the name of the server you want to delete, and view the databases under it that are affected. Enter your server name in the text box, such as the example, **mydemoserver**. Select **Delete**.
